- **Automatic reconnection** handling
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows, Mac, Linux)

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Starting an Online Game

1. **Launch the Game**
   ```bash
   python launcher.py
   ```

2. **Choose Online Multiplayer**
   - Use arrow keys to select "Online Multiplayer"
   - Press ENTER to confirm

3. **Host or Join**
   - **Host Game**: You create a server that others connect to
   - **Join Game**: You connect to someone else's server

### Hosting a Game (Server)

1. Select **"Host Game"** from the online menu
2. Wait for the server to start (you'll see your IP and port)
3. **Share your connection info** with the other player:
   - IP Address: `192.168.1.100` (example)
   - Port: `12345` (example)
4. Wait for the other player to connect
5. The game starts automatically once connected!

### Joining a Game (Client)

1. Select **"Join Game"** from the online menu
2. Enter the **host's IP address** when prompted
3. Enter the **host's port number** when prompted
4. Wait for connection to establish
5. The game starts automatically once connected!

## üîß Network Setup

### Local Network (Same WiFi/LAN)

For players on the same local network (same house, office, etc.):

1. **Find your local IP address:**
   ```bash
   python network_test.py ip
   ```

2. **Use the local IP** (usually starts with `192.168.` or `10.`)
3. **No router configuration needed!**

### Internet Play (Different Networks)

For players on different internet connections:

#### Option 1: Port Forwarding (Recommended)
1. **Host configures port forwarding** on their router
2. **Forward the game port** (shown when hosting) to your computer
3. **Share your public IP** (find at whatismyip.com)

#### Option 2: VPN Services (Easier)
- Use services like **Hamachi**, **ZeroTier**, or **Radmin VPN**
- Both players join the same VPN network
- Use the VPN IP addresses to connect

#### Option 3: Cloud Gaming Services
- Use services like **ngrok** to create a tunnel
- Follow their setup guides for TCP tunneling

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Network Connectivity Test

Run our built-in network test to diagnose issues:

```bash
python network_test.py test
```

This will check:
- ‚úÖ Local IP address detection
- ‚úÖ Server creation capability  
- ‚úÖ Loopback connections
- ‚úÖ Internet connectivity
- ‚úÖ Available ports

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "Cannot create server"
- **Check firewall settings** (allow Python/game through)
- **Run as administrator** (Windows)
- **Try a different port** (if prompted)

#### "Connection failed" 
- **Verify IP address and port** are correct
- **Check if host is running** and waiting for connections
- **Test connectivity:** `python network_test.py check <host> <port>`

#### "Connection drops during game"
- **Check internet stability** on both ends
- **Close bandwidth-heavy applications** (streaming, downloads)
- **Try a VPN connection** for more stable routing

#### "Game feels laggy"
- Network latency affects responsiveness
- **Use wired connections** when possible
- **Connect to geographically closer players**
- Current implementation optimizes for <200ms latency

## üéÆ Online Gameplay Features

### Synchronized Game State
- **Real-time piece movement** synchronization
- **Shared random piece sequences** (both players get same pieces)
- **Synchronized line clearing** animations
- **Live score and statistics** updates

### Attack System
- **Send garbage lines** when clearing 2+ lines simultaneously:
  - 2 lines = 1 garbage line
  - 3 lines = 2 garbage lines  
  - 4 lines (Tetris) = 4 garbage lines
- **Garbage lines appear at bottom** of opponent's grid
- **Strategic play** - time your attacks for maximum impact!

### Win Conditions
- **Elimination**: Opponent's grid fills up (game over)
- **Line Goal**: First to clear 30 lines wins the round
